			<p>Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. <i>The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem.</i> Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in central Madrid since 1947. </p>
			<p>In domestic football, the club has won 70 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 32 trophies: a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record eight FIFA Club World championships</p>
			<p>Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably <em> <strong>El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid.</strong> The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.</p>
